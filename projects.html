				<h3>Goals</h3>
				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Condense over 100 pages of audits to a practical spreadsheet</li>
						<li>
								Analyze site audits to determine which sites were failing,
								which sites needed help curing their audits, and what
								steps should be taken to improve audit scores currently
								and in the future.
						</li>
						<li>
								Present the findings in a dashboard to be shared with the
								sales manager's team
						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Methods</h3>
				<p>
					The following tools were used to complete the project:
					<ul>
						<li>Excel</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					The following techniques were used to complete the project:
					<ul>
						<li>Data entry</li>
						<li>Data normalization</li>
						<li>Data transformation</li>
						<li>Excel functions and formulas</li>
						<li>Excel macros</li>
						<li>Conditional formatting</li>
						<li>Data visualization</li>
						<li>Dashboard</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h3>Process</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Loading the Data</b>: The data was initially
						found in over 100 printed pages of audit information.
						Manual data entry was required to load the data into
						an Excel file into 3 separate tables: the
						<code>Sites</code> table used to store information
						for each site, including the site's identification
						number and initial score on the audit; the
						<code>Questions</code> table used to store
						information for each audit question that a
						dealer failed and needed to fix; and the
						<code>Question Values</code> table used to
						store information regarding each possible
						question on the BP Consumer Experience audit
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Transforming the Data</b>: Joins were performed
						between the 3 tables using the <code>XLOOKUP</code>
						function. The helped to calculate the site's scores
						as audit questions were cured.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Analyzing the Data</b>: Conditional formatting
						was used to identify sites with failing scores.
						Aggregate measures were calculated using the
						<code>AVERAGE</code>, <code>COUNTIFS</code>, and
						<code>SUMIFS</code> functions to
						assess the progress sites made on improving
						their scores and to determine what more work
						needed to be completed.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Presenting the Data</b>: An additional
						sheet was added to the file to create a dashboard
						to present the data. Bar plots were made to show
						the change in audit scores at each step of the
						audit process and to show the number of
						audit questions for each site. A pie chart was
						used to demonstrate what portion of the
						audit questions were resolved and which were
						never resolved. Additional blocks of text
						were added to highlight important information
						in the audits, such as the audit question
						number that occurred most often and the
						number of sites that initially were failing
						and passed when the audits were complete.
					</li>
				</ol>

				<h3>Findings and Recommendations</h3>
				<p>
					The project found that the sales manager successfully
					brought two sites from a failing score to a passing
					score and cured 20 of the 22 total audit questions that were
					possible to resolve. The project also found that the
					most common audit question by far was question 23,
					which checked if a site had up-to-date and BP
					branded brochures in its canisters at each gas
					pump. This quesiton in particular takes little time
					and effort to resolve. However, for a full 6 out of
					the 22 sites, the only question that was possible to
					resolve was question 23. This meant that 6 dedicated
					trips needed to be made all the way to these sites
					just to emptry their canisters and put in new brochures.
					To limit the number of unnecessary trips in the future
					and to save time, it was recommended that the sales
					manager remind his sites shortly before and during
					audits to keep their brochures up-to-date.

				<h2>Report on the Effects of Attendance on School Performance</h2>
				<p>
					This project studies and quantifies the relationship between
          class attendance and marks received for five high schools in
          2022 and 2023. It also studies the possible effects of the period
          a class is taken, the semester a class is taken, the school a
          student attends, and a student's grade level on the number of
          absences they have and how well they perform. The data
          used was sourced on
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marmarplz/highschool-period-attendance-versus-period-grades">Kaggle</a>
          and collected from an SQL database from the student information
          system from the school district where these schools reside.
          The data set is anonymized, so the particular schools and
          particular students whose data were collected are not
          identifiable.

        <h3>Process</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Loading the Data</b>: The data was sourced on
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marmarplz/highschool-period-attendance-versus-period-grades">Kaggle</a>
            in the form of two csv files, one for data from 2022
            and the other for data from 2023. The files were
            downloaded and loaded into the R project.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Profiling the Data</b>: To get a sense of the
            structure of the data and any problems it might
            have, the data was profiled. The names of the columns
            were simplified to clean up the output. The data types,
            distribution, and number of unique values in each
            column were tested for outliers, inconsistencies,
            misspellings, and missing data. The data was then
            tested for duplicates. This step discovered that
            the data didn't have any formatting errors; all of
            the values for categorical variables were consistent.
            The data in all numerical columns fell in the right
            ranges as well. However, six columns used to store
            the marks students received contained large amounts
            of missing data. This step also found that the 2022
            data contained information from 6 schools, but the
            2023 data contained data from 7 schools. Duplicate
            rows were also found.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Cleaning and Transformation</b>: The data from
            2022 and 2023 were combined into a single table,
            duplicate rows were removed, categorical columns
            were transformed into factors, numerical columns
            were converted from doubles to integers, the
            data was pivoted into a long data format, a column
            was created to bin the total number absences each
            student had, and a final column was made that
            calculated the percentage of classes that a student
            failed. Four total tables were created in this step
            that handled missing data and pivoting the data in
            a different way. The <code>school_data</code> table
            was unpivoted and did not remove rows with missing
            values. The <code>long_school_data_with_NAs</code>
            was pivoted but did not remove missing values.
            The <code>long_school_data</code> table was pivoted,
            and rows with missing data were removed after
            pivoting. The <code>complete_long_school_data</code>
            was pivoted, but rows with missing data were
            removed before the data was pivoted, so this
            table only contained data from the original table
            where all columns in every row were complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analysis and Visualization</b>: The relationships
            between the period number, semester, year, school,
            number of absences, grade level, mark, and
            failing percentage were all explored. Hypothesis
            tests were performed to determine if the
            relationships were significant, and data visualizations
            were made to spot patterns in the relationships.
            A random forest model was used to predict a
            student's mark given the number of absences they had,
            the school they went to, their
            grade level, the year, and the semester.
            A linear model was made to estimate the percentage
            of classes a student would fail given mostly the same
            information.
          </li>
        </ol>

				<h3>Findings and Recommendations</h3>
        <p>
          It was found that all of the given variables had a
          signficant impact on mark. Students performed best
          in periods 3 and 4, students performed worst in the
          second semester, students performed better in the
          year 2023, some schools had a higher percentage of F's
          than other, and students with a large number of
          absences tended to fail more classes. As little as
          50 total period absences or roughly 10 days of
          class time is enough to signficantly negatively
          impact the likeliness that a student will pass all
          their classes.
          However, both the random forest
          model and the linear model were poor predictors of
          the mark and fail percentage respectively. The random
          forest model offered only a marginal increase in
          accuracy over simply predicting that a mark would
          always be an A. The linear model similarly could
          only account for roughly 19% of the variance in the
          percentage of classes a student failed. While
          attendance and the rest of the variables do appear
          to have some correlation with performance, it is
          clear that they are far from the most impactful.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          To increase the likeliness of students performing
          well, students should be encouraged to attend as
          often as they can, and factors that prevent
          students from coming to class should be discovered
          and limited.

				<h2>Dashboard on Bigfoot Sightings</h2>
				<p>
					This project was used to analyze the context of
          big foot sightings in North America. This project
          studies descriptions of bigfoot sightings,
          including the weather, environment, time of day,
          and location, to find any patterns in the
          sightings.
          The data was
          found in three csv files on
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlocking-mysteries-of-bigfoot-through-sightings?resource=download&select=bfro_locations.csv">Kaggle</a>
          posted by Tim Renner.

          Due to licensing limitations, I cannot upload an
          interactive version of the dashboard on Power BI
          service, but here is a pdf to show the final
          dashboard.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Loading in the Data</b>: The data was sourced on
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/unlocking-mysteries-of-bigfoot-through-sightings?resource=download&select=bfro_locations.csv">Kaggle</a>
            and uploaded by Tim Renner, who gathered this information
            from the Big Foot Researchers Organization (BFRO).
            The data was stored in three tables:
            <code>bfro_locations</code>,
            <code>bfro_reports</code>, and
            <code>bfro_reports_geocoded</code>. The
            csv files for the tables were downloaded and
            uploaded into Power BI and connected on
            the <code>reportNumber</code> column, which
            stores the unique number for each bigfoot
            report at the BFRO. In order to handle the
            large amount of unstructured text data in
            the tables and create word clouds, I also
            downloaded a table of stop words that would
            be ignored so that they wouldn't clutter
            the graphs. The stopwords table was also sourced on
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rowhitswami/stopwords?select=stopwords.txt">Kaggle</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transforming the Data</b>: The data was
            not very clean when it was loaded in. Power
            BI's profiling tools were used to identify
            large amounts of missing data in various
            columns. In one of the tables, even the
            <code>reportNumber</code> column had
            missing entries. To check these columns,
            I first filtered for all of the rows that
            had a missing reportNumber and found that
            those rows had missing information in every
            column except the <code>index</code> column.
            I reversed the filtering and then removed
            the rows with a missing report number.
            I then recognized that the <code>longitude</code>
            column had very extreme outliers, with values
            much lower than -180. The rows with impossibly
            low longitudes were removed. In the <code>title</code>
            column of the <code>bfro_locations</code> table, the
            titles were prefixed with the report numbers. However,
            there was no need for the prefix, so the prefix
            was removed from each row. In all of the tables,
            the columns were renamed using camelcase so
            that the names were consistent across all
            tables. Lastly, all of the columns that contained
            text-heavy descriptions were transformed to
            lowercase to make them more suitable
            for analysis.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Analyzing the Data</b>: For this
            dashboard, visualizations were the primary
            method of analyzing the data. Word clouds
            were created of the titles, observations,
            and environment details to find common
            keywords. A world map was plotted to show
            the locations of sightings. A donut chart
            was made to show the portion of sightings
            made in each season, and a filled line plot
            was created to show the number of sightings
            at each moon phase.
          </li>
        </ol>

				<h3>Findings and Recommendations</h3>
				<p>
					The map of the sightings almost perfectly
          matches with a population density plot,
          indicating that bigfoot sightings are most
          likely in places where there are more people.
          There doesn't appear to be any specific
          location where the sightings are most likely.
          Since higher population density indicates an
          increase in sightings, it is possible that
          the increase in sightings is simply due to
          the increase in people. Rather than the
          absolute location, it appears that the
          environment is a better predictor of bigfoot
          sightings. Titles and observations of
          sightings typically mention camping in a
          forest or wooded environment.
				</p>

        <p>
          The weather conditions don't appear to
          have much effect on sightings either.
          Summaries of weather conditions indicate
          that sightings occur most often on clear
          days, but they still occur frequently on
          cloudy or rainy days. The frequency of sightings
          for any weather conditions appear to roughly
          match the frequency of those weather conditions
          occurring. In other words, since clear weather
          is the most common, it is not surprising
          that the most common weather conditions
          during a sighting is clear weather. Similarly,
          since cloudy and rainy weather is less common,
          it makes sense that there are fewer sightings
          with cloudy and rainy weather. Similarly, the
          moon phase doesn't appear to affect the likeliness
          of a sighting. The filled line plot of the
          moonphase didn't have any clear pattern; all
          of the data points appeared to just center
          around an average line. This indicates that
          the moonphase has little if any effect on
          sightings.
        </p>
        <p>
          One pattern that was found in the bigfoot
          sightings was the time at which they occurred.
          The approximate local time was always at a
          late time at night or an early time in the
          day when it would have been very dark and
          difficult to see. However, it appears that
          the intial timestamps were all set 11pm
          or 12pm UTC, indicating that the times
          provided might have been default values
          rather than the actual time of sightings.
        </p>
        <li>
          Diescriptions of sightings indicate that
          bigfoot is a large, hairy, man-like creature
          with big feet. Many observations also frequenty
          mention loud noises or "vocalizations."
        </li>
        <li>
          There don't appear to be any clear
          explanations for the sightings. The weather
          has little affect on the sightings,
          the sightings occur onl.........
